# Santander Customer Transaction Prediction
## Project description
In this challenge, we need to build a machine learning model prototype for Santander that helps indentify which customers will make a specific transaction in the future, irrespective of the amount of money transacted. The data provided for this competition has the same structure as the real data we have available to solve this problem.
## Goal
Create a machine learning model to indentify customers who will make a specific transaction in the future.
